# CodSoft
Welcome to my Data Science Internship Portfolio! This repository is a compilation of projects undertaken during my internship at Codsoft, serving as a testament to my proficiency in data analysis, machine learning, and effective problem-solving. The following overview provides a glimpse into the diverse range of projects I've successfully completed

Task 1: **Titanic Survival Detection:** This project centers on the analysis of the Titanic dataset to anticipate passenger survival. It encompasses comprehensive data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the construction of a machine learning model for predicting survival probabilities.

Task 2. **Movie Rating Prediction with Python:** Leveraging Python, this project establishes a movie rating prediction system. The process encompasses data acquisition, preprocessing, and the implementation of a machine learning model designed to forecast movie ratings accurately.

Task 3. **Iris Flower Classification:** An exploration of a classic machine learning task, the Iris Flower Classification project involves utilizing the Iris dataset to categorize iris flowers into distinct species based on their sepal and petal measurements.

Task 4. **Sales Prediction using Python:** This project is dedicated to predicting sales for a business, involving meticulous data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the construction of a predictive model aimed at forecasting future sales.

Task 5. **Credit Card Fraud Detection:** Focused on addressing class imbalance, the Credit Card Fraud Detection project develops a machine learning model proficient in identifying fraudulent credit card transactions. The project encompasses data preprocessing and utilizes logistic regression for accurate classification.
